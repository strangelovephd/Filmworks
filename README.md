# Filmworks Sales and Receipt Project


### Goals:
- Provide an intuitive CLI/menu based interface to create and save orders/receipts
- Create a serialization method in order to save customer data

### Personal Goals:
- Start a long-term C++ project for something other than school
- Challenge myself to create a fully featured and functional program
- Eventually port the program to a full GUI environment (probably in an attempt to learn the Qt framework)
